<!-- This program will allow me to render a calendar that shows when I'm busy
(unknown label) and when I have research confrences -->


I dont know if this will be javascript or what, but I need
to learn how to automatically make any changes on my google calendar automatically
create a [BUSY] tag (with timestamps?) on the google calendar for the website.
Only research associated events (maybe with a [RESEARCH] tag?) show up completely.
