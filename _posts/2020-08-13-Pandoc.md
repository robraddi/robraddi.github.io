## [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)—a friend

### Problem: Suppose you have a table in Word file (*.docx) and you want to extract the data from it and put inside a Pandas DataFrame.

#### Pandoc will convert various types of file formats. We will use Pandas to convert *.docx to html.

```bash
$ brew install pandoc
$ pandoc -s settimo2014comparison.docx -t html -o settimo2014comparison.html
```

### Now, load in the html file using `pandas`. **Note:** parses `<table>` tags, so text and figures is not an issue.

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.read_html("settimo2014comparison.html")
```
