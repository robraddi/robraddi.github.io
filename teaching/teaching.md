## [TU_Chem](https://robraddi.github.io/TU_Chem) is a collection of notebooks, quizzes, practice exams, etc. that I have put together for assisting the teaching of undergraduate chemistry courses at Temple University. These are **not for profit** and **strictly for teaching purposes**.
Although, the bulk of work is my own labor, a substantial amount of material inside these notebooks has been compiled from various textbooks and internet sources. I thank all who have aided me in this process.
