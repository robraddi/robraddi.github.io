I'm a well rounded chemist from the greater Philadelphia area that loves experiencing diverse cultures and meeting new people.  Hiking and programming are two activities that I couldn't live without.  I'm an active member of the [Voelz Lab](http://www.voelzlab.org) and currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Theoretical/Physical Chemistry at [Temple University](https://chem.cst.temple.edu).
